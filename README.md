# Features

This app covers 10000 words(HSK1~6) and each one has Japanese translating.

Most of other HSK app don't use regular Chinese font. It may mislead studying Chinese people about Chinese structure, but my app adopt exact simplified Chinese fonts which is close to handwriting.

Moreover, choosing answer type is too easy to answer for Japanese, therefore my app adopts just "correct" or "incorrect". After you finished quiz section, you can check what word is incorrect.
